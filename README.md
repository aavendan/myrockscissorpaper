Rock Paper Scissors with Google Teachable Machine, Vue JS, Tailwind CSS, Laracasts illustrations and Minions (sounds)

I have used again the magic of Google to train a visual machine learning model and turn everything into a classic game for my kids: Rock Paper Scissors.

#### Step 01: using Teachable Machine, Preparing training data (classes)
Open your webcam and grab some picture for every class:
- üëä 0 = Rock 
- ü§ö 1 = Paper 
- ‚úåÔ∏è 2 = Scissors
- None = a default class

#### Step 02: using Teachable Machine, Training (Don't switch tabs!)
In less than 1 min you will have your model ready for testing.

#### Step 03: Preview and test the Model
Do some testing

#### Step 04: Export the model (using Tensorflow.js option with Upload my model).
Grab the snippet code generated and let's create the game.

#### Step 05: import Vue JS, Tailwind CSS, Tensorflow js + Teachable Machine in html file.
Mix all things together. Add some sounds with Minions (winning/losing part).

#### Step 06: test the game
If everythings Ok... then upload all code on github and host the game on firebase hosting. 

Enjoy it.
